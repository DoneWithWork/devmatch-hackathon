# 🔧 Package Manager Lockfile Resolution

## ✅ **Issue Resolved Successfully**

The warning about multiple lockfiles has been fixed by:

1. **Removed conflicting `pnpm-lock.yaml`** - This was causing the lockfile conflict
2. **Cleaned `node_modules`** - Removed corrupted pnpm-generated dependencies
3. **Generated fresh `package-lock.json`** - Now using npm as the primary package manager

## 📋 **Current Setup**

- **Package Manager**: `npm` (recommended for consistency)
- **Lockfile**: `package-lock.json` ✅
- **Dependencies**: 835 packages installed successfully
- **Status**: Ready for development

## 🚨 **Lockfile Best Practices**

### **Stick to One Package Manager**

- ✅ **npm**: Use `npm install`, `npm run dev`, etc.
- ❌ **Don't mix**: Avoid using `pnpm` or `yarn` in the same project

### **Commit Lockfiles**

- ✅ **Always commit** `package-lock.json` to git
- ✅ **Never manually edit** lockfiles
- ✅ **Keep lockfiles in sync** across team members

### **If You See This Warning Again**

```bash
⚠ Warning: Found multiple lockfiles
```

**Quick Fix:**

```bash
# Remove the conflicting lockfile
Remove-Item pnpm-lock.yaml -Force  # or yarn.lock

# Clean and reinstall
cmd /c "rmdir /s /q node_modules"
npm install
```

## 🛠️ **Your Project Status**

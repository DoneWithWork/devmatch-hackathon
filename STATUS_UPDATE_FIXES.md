# ✅ Admin Dashboard Status Update Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Private Key Format Error** ✅

- **Problem**: `Wrong secretKey size. Expected 32 bytes, got 52`
- **Cause**: Private key in Sui format (`suiprivkey1...`) wasn't being decoded properly
- **Fix**: Added proper Sui private key parsing in `approve-issuer/route.ts`
- **Result**: Approve operations now work on blockchain

### 2. **Button Display Logic** ✅

- **Problem**: Buttons still showing after approval/rejection
- **Cause**: Status updates working correctly, but no visual feedback for completed actions
- **Fix**: Added status display sections for approved/rejected applications
- **Result**: Clear visual feedback showing application status

### 3. **Status Display Enhancements** ✅

- **Added**: Green "✅ Application Approved" banner for approved applications
- **Added**: Red "❌ Application Rejected" banner for rejected applications
- **Added**: Blockchain integration indicator for approved applications
- **Result**: Users can clearly see the outcome of their actions

## How It Works Now:

1. **Pending Applications**: Show approve/reject buttons
2. **Approved Applications**: Show green success banner with ✅ icon
3. **Rejected Applications**: Show red rejection banner with ❌ icon
4. **Status Changes**: Automatically update without page refresh
5. **Blockchain Integration**: Clearly indicated when operations complete on-chain

## Testing:

- ✅ Private key parsing fixed for Sui format
- ✅ UI updates properly after approve/reject actions
- ✅ Clear visual feedback for all application states
- ✅ Buttons only appear for pending applications
